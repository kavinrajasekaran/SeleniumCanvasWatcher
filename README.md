## Setup

1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SeleniumCanvasWatcher.git
    cd SeleniumCanvasWatcher

2. Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

    source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

    You must also download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads that matches your installed Chrome version and put it in your PATH or the project folder.

## Usage

1. Edit the Canvas URL

    In `canvas_quizwatcher.py`, change the following line:

    CANVAS_URL = "https://yourcanvas.instructure.com/courses/123456/quizzes"

    Replace it with your courseâ€™s actual Quizzes page URL.

2. Run the Script

    python3 canvas_quizwatcher.py

    On first run, you'll be prompted to log in manually in the browser window. The script will then check for new quizzes every 20 seconds and notify you.

- Quiz titles are stored in known_quizzes.pkl
- Check interval is configurable by editing CHECK_INTERVAL
